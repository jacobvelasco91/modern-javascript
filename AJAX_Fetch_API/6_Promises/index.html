    <h1>Promises</h1>
    <h3>promises are an ALTERNATIVE to callbacks for handling asynchronous programming</h3>
    <h4>Notes on promises</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Promises are a pattern that greatly simplifies asynchronous programming by making the code look synchronous and avoid problems associated with callbacks</li>
      <li>A promise is an object that is used as a placeholder for the eventual results of a deffered program computation</li>
      <li>A promise is a container for a future value</li>
      <li>we create a promise when a certain task completion is uncertain or its takes too long</li>
      <li>The parameters conventionally named resolve and reject, mark successful and unsuccessful eventual completion of the executor function, respectively.</li>
      <li>All Promise instances have a .then() method on them.</li>
      <li>.then() accepts two callbacks. The first callback is invoked when the promise is resolved. The second callback is executed when the promise is rejected.</li>
      <li> new promise take one argument a function. that function takes two arugments : resolve,reject</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Syntax:</h2>
    <p>
      const myPromise = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){<br>
        if(true){<br>
          resolve('successful computation of a program');<br>
        }<br>
        reject('not successful of computation of a program');<br>
      } );<br>
    </p>
    <h2>ES6 Syntax</h2>
    <p>new Promise((resolve,reject) => { code here });</p>
